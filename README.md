## Project Description
This project is a Minecraft-inspired 3D world developed using A-Frame and p5.js, allowing users to explore, build, and modify the environment. Users can freely move and fly around the world, select blocks from an inventory, and place or remove blocks, similar to Minecraft's creative mode. The project showcases my skills in 3D graphics, interactive environments, and user interface design.

## Instructions
** 1. Movement and Camera: **
* Use WASD to move around freely.
* Rotate the camera angle using mouse drag.

** 2. Toolbar and Inventory: **
* Press 1 through 9 to select blocks from the toolbar for block placement.
* Press 'E' to open/close the inventory.
* Clicking on a toolbar item and dropping it into the inventory removes it from the toolbar.
* Clicking on an inventory item and dropping it into the toolbar adds it to the toolbar.

** 3. Block Placement and Deletion: **
* Press 'V' to activate block placement/deletion mode; press again to deactivate.
* While activated:
    * Hovering over a block makes the hovering side of the block translucent.
    * Press 'C' to place a block on the translucent side of the hovering block.
    * Press 'R' to make the hovering side of the block translucent red, and clicking on the block's side will remove the block.
